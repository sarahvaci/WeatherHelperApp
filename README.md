Weather Dashboard displays the weather for a given city and provides a 5 day forecast

This project is a Weather Dashboard which needed the following features:

1. The application allows the user to search for any city and provides the current weather conditions for the user's search input
2. The weather information provided to the user includes the temperature, the humidity, the windspeed, and the UV index for a given date
3. The user is also given a 5-day forecast for the city that they searched
4. The application also stores the user's most recent search item after they close their browser
5. Once the user reopens the application, they are able to view their last searched city and the corresponding weather conditions 


I know this project isn't done yet, but just being able to show a results page makes me feel good. I'll keep working on this project until it's fixed.
